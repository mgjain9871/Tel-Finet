Recently moved to Noida? 
Having troubles finding perfect telecom services in your area.
Then worry not !!

 *YOU HAVE ARRIVED AT JUST THE RIGHT PLACE !!*
 
 *TEL-FINET* gives you the information of number of users in a particular sector of Noida. Using this information, the user can decide for him/herself the best network in that area.

Question : How Tel-Finet does this... ?? (inside working üëÄ)
Answer : Well!! We have an ever increasing database of all the necessary information in this regard.
Also, we have future plans of providing information on broadband service provider all over Noida.
   
## Relevance to the CodejamV2 theme 
We believe that people move from places to places and when they do they are always on the lookout for the best of the things out there,be it restaurants, cafes, drivethrough,
apartments, supermarkets etc. But we often face problems regarding the network in the area and thats where *Tel-Finet* comes to your rescue !

Every network operator claims itself to be the best out there ,but we all know how 
Network quality varies from region to region. There is no platform out there that provides you informational data of  network  quality of different operators in the town,.
We have collated the network signal strengths varying from region to region so that the user finds the best operating network in their area and does not have to face problems regarding signal strength loss which is a very big concern in itself.

Hence we have solved a very major issue lying out there in the world
Creating something very unique and useful that serves everyone.
THAT‚ÄôS HOW WE HAVE KILLED THE CLICH√â AND JUSTIFIED THE THEME OF ‚ÄúTHE CODEJAM .
